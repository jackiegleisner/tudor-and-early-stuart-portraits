For many years, these portraits remained understudied. The works varied in both their state of preservation and their significance. Some were attributed to the handful of artists whose names are known from the period, and others, typically in a poorer state, were consigned to storage and anonymity.</p>\n<p>Over the past decade and a half, several UK-based collections have produced technical catalogues of their early portraits, yielding a host of discoveries about contemporary studio practice, while demonstrating the pivotal role that scientific analysis can play in establishing a technical profile of the working methods of specific artists. In effort to utilize these new sources and better understand our own early portraits, YCBA staff has developed an in-depth technical catalogue comprising its thirty plus full-size oil paintings and fifteen miniatures. Many of the paintings were once part of a set of portraits that have splintered over the centuries. Much of the work of this project has involved the careful recovery of all the evidence that survives for these otherwise poorly documented paintings. Integral to this process has been collaboration and the sharing of data with other institutions resulting in the largest technical survey of portrait production in early modern Britain.</p>\n<p>Partnering with Yale’s Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage, the project has benefitted from cutting-edge technologies that can look through the veils of age and condition to shed new light on some of the most important paintings and painters of the period. The result of this synthesis of conservation, art history and science is the most thoroughgoing account of Tudor and early Stuart painting.</p>\n","length":293,"subtitle":null,"title":"Introduction","type":"page","url":"http://localhost:8080/introduction/"},{"content":"","length":0,"title":"Technical Catalogue","type":"table-of-contents","url":"http://localhost:8080/Technical%20Catalogue/"},{"content":"","length":0,"title":"Full-Size Portraits","type":"table-of-contents","url":"http://localhost:8080/Technical%20Catalogue/Full%20Size%20paintings/"},{"content":"","length":0,"title":"Katherine Knollys (née Carey), Lady Knollys","type":"entry","url":"http://localhost:8080/Technical%20Catalogue/Full%20Size%20paintings/01/"},{"content":"","length":0,"title":"Robert Dudley, first Earl of Leicester","type":"entry","url":"http://localhost:8080/Technical%20Catalogue/Full%20Size%20paintings/02/"},{"content":"","length":0,"title":"Sir Percival Hart","type":"entry","url":"http://localhost:8080/Technical%20Catalogue/Full%20Size%20paintings/03/"},{"content":"<p>This painting is newly identified as Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Thomas Watson (d. 1621) of Westminster and Halstead, Kent. The reidentification of the sitter is largely based on the striking resemblance between her and a portrait of Elizabeth Watson now at Tate Britain (<strong>fig. 1</strong>). Close comparison and an overlay of the two faces reveals that this is the same likeness, reversed and reused. The original source, most likely a drawing taken from life, was adjusted minimally to accommodate a slight shift in angle; in the Tate portrait, Watson’s face is narrower and seen more frontally.</p>\n<figure id=\"peake-1\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#peake-1\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/peake-elizabeth-pope_02.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#peake-1\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 1</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Robert Peake the Elder, <em>Lady Elizabeth Pope (née Watson)</em>, ca.1615, oil on panel, 61 x 77.5 cm.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Tate Britain.</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/peake-elizabeth-pope_02.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#peake-1\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 1</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Robert Peake the Elder, <em>Lady Elizabeth Pope (née Watson)</em>, ca.1615, oil on panel, 61 x 77.5 cm.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Tate Britain.</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<h2>Making the painting</h2>\n<p><strong>Support and preparation</strong><br>\nThe portrait was completed in oil on a plain-weave linen canvas. The canvas was prepared with a white chalk ground followed by a light gray secondary ground composed of lead white and bone black pigment, typical of Peake’s practice. Peake used a dry, carbon-based material to draw each part of the composition: the figure, her costume, the background, and the fictive oval frame. The reserved, faint lines delineating Watson’s facial features indicate that it was transferred from a pre-existing template or sketch from life. In both the YCBA and Tate portraits, the quality of line shifts from restrained and soft (on the face) to general and energetic (on the hands, hair and backgrounds), attesting to Peake’s confidence in working independently from a pattern, especially surrounding the sitter’s face (<strong>fig. 2</strong>).</p>\n<figure id=\"peake-2\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#peake-2\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/peake-elizabeth-pope_03.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#peake-2\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 2</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Infra-red details of Watson’s hands from the YCBA and Tate portraits.

While pentimenti like these are often associated with primary versions, or the artists’ first approach to a likeness, it is more plausible that Peake’s first drawing of Watson was for the formal portrait (at the YCBA), her rounded face turned three quarters to the left represents his conventional practice. The informality of the Tate portrait, with a nipple exposed through her loose hair, affirms that it would have been displayed privately and was most likely produced from the same drawing made for Peake’s more ‘public’ portrait (at the YBCA), explaining why her features were altered in the Tate version. In other words, Peake did not have a new sitting with Watson but reworked the source that he already had to fulfil this unusual commission.</p>\n<figure id=\"peake-3\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#peake-3\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/peake-elizabeth-pope_04.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#peake-3\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 3</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Details of Watson’s nose and mouth from the YCBA (regular light, flipped horizontally) and Tate (infrared and regular light photos) showing how her facial features were shifted upward during painting.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Tate Britain and Yale Center for British Art.</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/peake-elizabeth-pope_04.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#peake-3\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 3</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Details of Watson’s nose and mouth from the YCBA (regular light, flipped horizontally) and Tate (infrared and regular light photos) showing how her facial features were shifted upward during painting.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Tate Britain and Yale Center for British Art.</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p><strong>Paint layer</strong><br>\nThe paint layer was built up using a mostly wet-over-dry, economical system with two distinctive methods of application. The first is characterized by meticulous blending to form soft gradations and three-dimensional volumes, the second by a looser, brusquer technique in which brushwork was left visible and each unblended stoke forms a component of the composition (a highlight on drapery, one strand of a feather, a sliver thread). Peake first painted broad fields of a mid-tone color to serve as a base for Watson’s flesh, hair, costume, and background. The sequence of paint application shows that he ‘worked up’ each element in the portrait simultaneously, allowing one passage (like the dress or background) to dry while he, or his assistants, moved on to another; a time-efficient and labor-saving system.</p>\n<p><strong>Flesh</strong><br>\nBecause the flesh paint was applied so thinly, the gray ground remains visible around Watson’s features, imparting a cool tone to her complexion. The artist then used a transparent brown paint, a mixture of ochers and earth pigment like umber, to reinforce the contours of the facial features and hands (<strong>figs. 4 and 5</strong>). Typical of Peake’s approach to younger sitters, the brushwork on Watson’s flesh is closed, the paint softly blended to a porcelain-like smoothness. Above this, a fine-tipped sable brush was used to draw individual eyelashes, her cupid bow lip crease and the network of blue lines across her pale décolletage and temples that suggest veins beneath the skin (<strong>fig. 6</strong>).</p>\n<figure id=\"peake-4\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#peake-4\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/peake-elizabeth-pope_05.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#peake-4\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 4</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">The paint layer is thinner along the contours of Watson’s facial features.

Atop the silver-grey base of Watson’s dress, Peake used pure black and white pigment to indicate embroidery, spangles, appliqué rosettes, and delicate lace. These brushstrokes sit proud of the paint surface to yield a network of tactile metallic threads and sparkles. (<strong>fig. 7</strong>) Gold mounted jewels were first blocked in with iron-based pigment, like brown ocher. When dry, the body colors of the gems and enamel were added; charcoal black for the diamonds and black enamel; lead white, azurite and vermilion for the colored enamel. Above this, shadows and highlights were added to lend depth to the stones and three dimensionality to the enamelwork. The pearls were completed in a similar, basically three-step, system beginning with a gray base layer followed by cool and warm highlights: bluish, azurite-containing stokes at left and buttery (lead tin) yellow dashes at right. Daubs of the same stiff yellow were applied across all gold jewelry to form sharp prongs and highlights, their frequency varied for a naturalistic twinkle (<strong>fig. 8</strong>).</p>\n<figure id=\"peake-7\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#peake-7\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/peake-elizabeth-pope_08.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#peake-7\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 7</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Details of <em>Portrait of a Woman, possibly Elizabeth Pope</em> showing variations in brushwork from the seamless blending of flesh tones to energetic dashes of impasto highlights.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Yale Center for British Art.</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/peake-elizabeth-pope_08.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#peake-7\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 7</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Details of <em>Portrait of a Woman, possibly Elizabeth Pope</em> showing variations in brushwork from the seamless blending of flesh tones to energetic dashes of impasto highlights.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Yale Center for British Art.</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<figure id=\"peake-8\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#peake-8\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/peake-elizabeth-pope_09.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#peake-8\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 8</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Micro photographs of Watson’s enamel bracelet, blueish pearls and gold-mounted diamonds.

The folds of drapery were painted using mostly vermilion and lead white paint, above which layers of a deep red glaze were added to strengthen shadows and impart a berry-red sheen. Her lace was added between these two stages of drapery painting, the red glaze occasionally overlapping the lace (<strong>figs 9 and 10</strong>). The reason for this is practical. Red lake dries very slowly, is easily smudged and is sticky when wet; resultantly, it is usually among the last pigments applied. The oval frame was rendered in three steps, beginning with a thin base of yellow ocher. When this had completely dried the figurative elements were added with a lean mixture of brown earth and umber. The thin, inner edge of the frame was among the last details added to the composition, its bright yellow highlight (yellow ocher and lead white) applied thickly, effectively pushing Watson’s luminous figure behind its shallow barrier.</p>\n<figure id=\"peake-9\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#peake-9\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/peake-elizabeth-pope_10.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#peake-9\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 9</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">The textured pattern of Elizabeth’s yellow lace collar is overlapped by the red lake glaze which covers the drapery behind her.

The pattern may relate to a playing card, which were commonly used as a support for miniatures in this period although in most cases the suit or face of the card is visible on the verso.</p>\n<figure id=\"hilliard-verso\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-verso\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/Hilliard_02.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-verso\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 1</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Nicholas Hilliard, <em>Portrait of a Lady</em>, verso, between 1600 and 1615, watercolor and gouache on vellum laid onto card, Yale Center for British Art, Paul Mellon Collection.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Yale Center for British Art.</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/Hilliard_02.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-verso\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 1</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Nicholas Hilliard, <em>Portrait of a Lady</em>, verso, between 1600 and 1615, watercolor and gouache on vellum laid onto card, Yale Center for British Art, Paul Mellon Collection.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Yale Center for British Art.</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p><strong>Flesh</strong><br>\nThe first pigment layer laid down was the “carnation,” a flesh-colored ground described by Hillard in his treatise <em>Concerning the Arte of Limning</em>. Here, it is thick enough to cover the texture of the vellum although its hue is pale, comprising sparce black and red particles, the latter identified as vermilion. There are a scattered pale pink particles in this layer, apparently a faded red lake (glaze) pigment, but it is unlikely that these would have altered the complexion significantly. There is little modelling in the flesh. The cheekbones and neck bear faint strokes of a carbon-based black paint. The bridge of the nose is captured with a faint line of this paint. The nostril was placed with a warm reddish-brown paint followed by a yellowish (organic lake) shadow, the thin wash spread over across the underside of the nose (<strong>fig. 2</strong>). The lips were painted with stippled brushstrokes of a pale red paint containing vermilion pigment while the lip crease and corners were defined with halting strokes of a red lake, now brown in hue due to discoloration and fading. There is little modelling around the mouth area except for a few strokes of thin brown paint beneath the lower lip.</p>\n<figure id=\"hilliard-1\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-1\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/Hilliard_03.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-1\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 2</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Detail of nose showing carnation color, the warm nostril composed of earth pigment and a yellowish wash across the underside of the nose.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Yale Center for British Art.</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/Hilliard_03.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-1\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 2</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Detail of nose showing carnation color, the warm nostril composed of earth pigment and a yellowish wash across the underside of the nose.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Yale Center for British Art.</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p><strong>Eyes</strong><br>\nThe eyes were first defined with a thin wash of warm brown paint containing red earth particles (<strong>fig. 3</strong>). The pupils, rendered with a burnt (bone) black, overlap these lines and are slightly raised. The gray color irises, a mixture of black and white pigment, were painted in next, beginning with a thin overall wash and then tiny, discreet stokes that define the outer edge of each. The whites of the eyes were painted more thickly with lead white-containing paint, which has developed small cracks. The highlights on the eyes were added over the pupils and irises with the same creamy white paint. Eyelashes were indicated with minute, broken strokes of dark brown/black pigment dotting the line of the upper eyelid. The eye sockets show little extant modelling, some of which may be lost to the fading of lake pigments; for example, the inner corners of the eyes retain a subtle rosy hue (perhaps once a deep pink) and there are faint strokes of light brown beneath the eye which may have been reinforced with a red or yellow lake.</p>\n<figure id=\"hilliard-2\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-2\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/Hilliard_04.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-2\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 3</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Detail of the left eye.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Yale Center for British Art.</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/Hilliard_04.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-2\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 3</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Detail of the left eye.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Yale Center for British Art.</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p><strong>Hair</strong><br>\nThe layer structure of the hair and its interplay with the background is complex, demonstrating how well planned the composition was at an early stage. Tendrils of hair were first placed with a thin wash of earth-based pigment. The azurite blue background was then “floated in” around the sitter’s silhouette and certain tendrils of hair. Due to the coarseness or grittiness of high-grade azurite, it does not flow willingly off the brush the way other pigments do in a watercolor medium. Hilliard describes his practice of wetting the area destined for azurite and letting the pigment flow into the passage. This is well illustrated in an X-ray fluorescence scan, which shows how the copper-based pigment creates a halo around the sitter’s head, its concentration dissipating as it nears her silhouette (<strong>fig. 4</strong>). Texture was then added to the hair using brown and yellow ocher pigment, building from dark shadows to a light warm brown for highlights on the waves, some of this paint added on top of the dry blue background (<strong>fig. 5</strong>).</p>\n<figure id=\"hilliard-3\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-3\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/Hilliard_05.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-3\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 4</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">X-ray map of copper, relating to azurite pigment in the background.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Yale Center for British Art.</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/Hilliard_05.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-3\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 4</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">X-ray map of copper, relating to azurite pigment in the background.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Yale Center for British Art.</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<figure id=\"hilliard-4\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-4\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/Hilliard_06.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-4\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 5</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Detail of the hair, left, showing some strands left in reserve and others painted directly over the azurite background.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Yale Center for British Art.</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/Hilliard_06.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-4\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 5</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Detail of the hair, left, showing some strands left in reserve and others painted directly over the azurite background.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Yale Center for British Art.</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p><strong>Dress</strong><br>\nThe red color of the dress was blocked in with a red lake, now notably faded. This red does not overlap decorative elements on the dress, affirming that the design was planned from the outset and that Hillard used his materials judiciously. Indeed, lines of a carbon-based black paint can be seen through upper paint layers following the contours of the dress and its ornament, indicating that its details were sketched, perhaps to emulate a real garment owned by the sitter. Similar guidelines are visible on the unfinished miniature portrait by Isaac Oliver (Hilliard’s pupil) of Elizabeth I now at the Victorian &amp; Albert Museum (<strong>fig. 6</strong>) Dashes of lead white were next added to her sleeve and the left side of her torso, lending three-dimensionality to the dress. More red lake was applied on top of this to maintain the garment’s deep, berry red color, the thicker dashes of shadow along her right side the most intact today.</p>\n<figure id=\"hilliard-5\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-5\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/Hilliard_07.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-5\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 6</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Isaac Oliver (ca. 1565-1617), <em>Elizabeth I</em>, watercolor on vellum, 82mm x 52mm.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Victoria and Albert Museum.</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/Hilliard_07.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-5\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 6</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Isaac Oliver (ca. 1565-1617), <em>Elizabeth I</em>, watercolor on vellum, 82mm x 52mm.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Victoria and Albert Museum.</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Lace was added after the hair and the red paint on the dress were dry, the basic pattern drawn with a light gray paint followed by impasto highlights of pure lead white, which, like the white on her eyes, has developed its own craquelure. The now black, lacy stripes on the dress were once vibrant silver, confirmed by XRF analysis (<strong>fig. 7</strong>). These were among the last details added to the composition. The silver overlaps the sitter’s lace and even the gold border around the perimeter of the miniature, yet in some places it lies beneath final highlights, affirming that Hilliard went back to tweak details and add finishing touches (<strong>fig. 8</strong>).</p>\n<figure id=\"hilliard-6\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-6\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/Hilliard_08.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-6\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 7</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">XRF map showing the distribution of silver in the miniature.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Yale Center for British Art.</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/Hilliard_08.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-6\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 7</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">XRF map showing the distribution of silver in the miniature.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Yale Center for British Art.</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<figure id=\"hilliard-7\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-7\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/Hilliard_09.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-7\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 8</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Detail of the tarnish silver detail on the red dress, showing where it overlaps the gold border.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Yale Center for British Art.</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/Hilliard_09.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#hilliard-7\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 8</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Detail of the tarnish silver detail on the red dress, showing where it overlaps the gold border.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Yale Center for British Art.</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p><strong>Jewelry</strong><br>\nEach pearl of the sitter’s necklace and earrings were created with a single dot of pure lead white paint, delivered from the tip of a fine brush. Each received a single highlight of silver, similar to what we see today, although these highlights are restoration, concealing the original, tarnished silver.
