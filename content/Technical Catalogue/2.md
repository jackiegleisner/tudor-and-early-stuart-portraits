## Making the miniature

The miniature was executed in watercolor on vellum adhered to card. On the reverse of the card are diagonal lines of black and blue paint (**Fig. 2.1**). The slightly raised "lips" along the edges of the black lines suggest they were masked off before application. The pattern may relate to a playing card, which were commonly used as a support for miniatures in this period although in most cases the suit or face of the card is visible on the verso.

**Flesh** 
The first pigment layer laid down was the “carnation,” a flesh-colored ground described by Hillard in his treatise *Concerning the Arte of Limning*. Here, it is thick enough to cover the texture of the vellum although its hue is pale, comprising sparce black and red particles, the latter identified as vermilion. There are a scattered pale pink particles in this layer, apparently a faded red lake (glaze) pigment, but it is unlikely that these would have altered the complexion significantly. There is little modelling in the flesh. The cheekbones and neck bear faint strokes of a carbon-based black paint. The bridge of the nose is captured with a faint line of this paint. The nostril was placed with a warm reddish-brown paint followed by a yellowish (organic lake) shadow, the thin wash spread over across the underside of the nose (**Fig. 2.2**). The lips were painted with stippled brushstrokes of a pale red paint containing vermilion pigment while the lip crease and corners were defined with halting strokes of a red lake, now brown in hue due to discoloration and fading. There is little modelling around the mouth area except for a few strokes of thin brown paint beneath the lower lip.

**Eyes** 
The eyes were first defined with a thin wash of warm brown paint containing red earth particles (**Fig. 2.3**). The pupils, rendered with a burnt (bone) black, overlap these lines and are slightly raised. The gray color irises, a mixture of black and white pigment, were painted in next, beginning with a thin overall wash and then tiny, discreet stokes that define the outer edge of each. The whites of the eyes were painted more thickly with lead white-containing paint, which has developed small cracks. The highlights on the eyes were added over the pupils and irises with the same creamy white paint. Eyelashes were indicated with minute, broken strokes of dark brown/black pigment dotting the line of the upper eyelid. The eye sockets show little extant modelling, some of which may be lost to the fading of lake pigments; for example, the inner corners of the eyes retain a subtle rosy hue (perhaps once a deep pink) and there are faint strokes of light brown beneath the eye which may have been reinforced with a red or yellow lake.

**Hair**
The layer structure of the hair and its interplay with the background is complex, demonstrating how well planned the composition was at an early stage. Tendrils of hair were first placed with a thin wash of earth-based pigment. The azurite blue background was then "floated in" around the sitter’s silhouette and certain tendrils of hair. Due to the coarseness or grittiness of high-grade azurite, it does not flow willingly off the brush the way other pigments do in a watercolor medium. Hilliard describes his practice of wetting the area destined for azurite and letting the pigment flow into the passage. This is well illustrated in an X-ray fluorescence scan, which shows how the copper-based pigment creates a halo around the sitter’s head, its concentration dissipating as it nears her silhouette (**Fig. 2.4**). Texture was then added to the hair using brown and yellow ocher pigment, building from dark shadows to a light warm brown for highlights on the waves, some of this paint added on top of the dry blue background (**Fig. 2.5**).

**Dress**
The red color of the dress was blocked in with a red lake, now notably faded. This red does not overlap decorative elements on the dress, affirming that the design was planned from the outset and that Hillard used his materials judiciously. Indeed, lines of a carbon-based black paint can be seen through upper paint layers following the contours of the dress and its ornament, indicating that its details were sketched, perhaps to emulate a real garment owned by the sitter. Similar guidelines are visible on the unfinished miniature portrait by Isaac Oliver (Hilliard’s pupil) of Elizabeth I now at the Victorian & Albert Museum (**Fig. 2.6**) Dashes of lead white were next added to her sleeve and the left side of her torso, lending three-dimensionality to the dress. More red lake was applied on top of this to maintain the garment’s deep, berry red color, the thicker dashes of shadow along her right side the most intact today.

Lace was added after the hair and the red paint on the dress were dry, the basic pattern drawn with a light gray paint followed by impasto highlights of pure lead white, which, like the white on her eyes, has developed its own craquelure. The now black, lacy stripes on the dress were once vibrant silver, confirmed by XRF analysis (**Fig. 2.7**). These were among the last details added to the composition. The silver overlaps the sitter’s lace and even the gold border around the perimeter of the miniature, yet in some places it lies beneath final highlights, affirming that Hilliard went back to tweak details and add finishing touches (**Fig. 2.8**).

**Jewelry**
Each pearl of the sitter’s necklace and earrings were created with a single dot of pure lead white paint, delivered from the tip of a fine brush. Each received a single highlight of silver, similar to what we see today, although these highlights are restoration, concealing the original, tarnished silver. The setting for her pearl drop earring was first painted with yellow ochre and then highlighted with shell gold. Apart from the thin gold boarder, that is the only gold present in the portrait (**Fig. 2.9**).
