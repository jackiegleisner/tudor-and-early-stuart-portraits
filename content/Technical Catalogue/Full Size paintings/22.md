This painting is newly identified as Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Thomas Watson (d. 1621) of Westminster and Halstead, Kent. The reidentification of the sitter is largely based on the striking resemblance between her and a portrait of Elizabeth Watson now at Tate Britain (**fig. 1**). Close comparison and an overlay of the two faces reveals that this is the same likeness, reversed and reused. The original source, most likely a drawing taken from life, was adjusted minimally to accommodate a slight shift in angle; in the Tate portrait, Watson’s face is narrower and seen more frontally.

## Making the painting

**Support and preparation**
The portrait was completed in oil on a plain-weave linen canvas. The canvas was prepared with a white chalk ground followed by a light gray secondary ground composed of lead white and bone black pigment, typical of Peake’s practice. Peake used a dry, carbon-based material to draw each part of the composition: the figure, her costume, the background, and the fictive oval frame. The reserved, faint lines delineating Watson’s facial features indicate that it was transferred from a pre-existing template or sketch from life. In both the YCBA and Tate portraits, the quality of line shifts from restrained and soft (on the face) to general and energetic (on the hands, hair and backgrounds), attesting to Peake’s confidence in working independently from a pattern, especially surrounding the sitter’s face (**fig. 2**).

In the Tate portrait, Elizabeth’s features were shifted during the painting process, her nose, lips and right eye moved upwards (**fig. 3**). While pentimenti like these are often associated with primary versions, or the artists’ first approach to a likeness, it is more plausible that Peake’s first drawing of Watson was for the formal portrait (at the YCBA), her rounded face turned three quarters to the left represents his conventional practice. The informality of the Tate portrait, with a nipple exposed through her loose hair, affirms that it would have been displayed privately and was most likely produced from the same drawing made for Peake’s more ‘public’ portrait (at the YBCA), explaining why her features were altered in the Tate version. In other words, Peake did not have a new sitting with Watson but reworked the source that he already had to fulfil this unusual commission.

**Paint layer**
The paint layer was built up using a mostly wet-over-dry, economical system with two distinctive methods of application. The first is characterized by meticulous blending to form soft gradations and three-dimensional volumes, the second by a looser, brusquer technique in which brushwork was left visible and each unblended stoke forms a component of the composition (a highlight on drapery, one strand of a feather, a sliver thread). Peake first painted broad fields of a mid-tone color to serve as a base for Watson’s flesh, hair, costume, and background. The sequence of paint application shows that he ‘worked up’ each element in the portrait simultaneously, allowing one passage (like the dress or background) to dry while he, or his assistants, moved on to another; a time-efficient and labor-saving system. 

**Flesh**
Because the flesh paint was applied so thinly, the gray ground remains visible around Watson’s features, imparting a cool tone to her complexion. The artist then used a transparent brown paint, a mixture of ochers and earth pigment like umber, to reinforce the contours of the facial features and hands (**figs. 4 and 5**). Typical of Peake’s approach to younger sitters, the brushwork on Watson’s flesh is closed, the paint softly blended to a porcelain-like smoothness. Above this, a fine-tipped sable brush was used to draw individual eyelashes, her cupid bow lip crease and the network of blue lines across her pale décolletage and temples that suggest veins beneath the skin (**fig. 6**).

**Jewelry and lace**
The costume and jewelry are defined by crisp, unblended brushwork. Atop the silver-grey base of Watson’s dress, Peake used pure black and white pigment to indicate embroidery, spangles, appliqué rosettes, and delicate lace. These brushstrokes sit proud of the paint surface to yield a network of tactile metallic threads and sparkles. (**fig. 7**) Gold mounted jewels were first blocked in with iron-based pigment, like brown ocher. When dry, the body colors of the gems and enamel were added; charcoal black for the diamonds and black enamel; lead white, azurite and vermilion for the colored enamel. Above this, shadows and highlights were added to lend depth to the stones and three dimensionality to the enamelwork. The pearls were completed in a similar, basically three-step, system beginning with a gray base layer followed by cool and warm highlights: bluish, azurite-containing stokes at left and buttery (lead tin) yellow dashes at right. Daubs of the same stiff yellow were applied across all gold jewelry to form sharp prongs and highlights, their frequency varied for a naturalistic twinkle (**fig. 8**).

**Background**
As noted above, the background and fictive oval were worked up in tandem with Watson’s figure. The folds of drapery were painted using mostly vermilion and lead white paint, above which layers of a deep red glaze were added to strengthen shadows and impart a berry-red sheen. Her lace was added between these two stages of drapery painting, the red glaze occasionally overlapping the lace (**figs 9**). The reason for this is practical. Red lake dries very slowly, is easily smudged and is sticky when wet; resultantly, it is usually among the last pigments applied. The oval frame was rendered in three steps, beginning with a thin base of yellow ocher. When this had completely dried the figurative elements were added with a lean mixture of brown earth and umber. The thin, inner edge of the frame was among the last details added to the composition, its bright yellow highlight (yellow ocher and lead white) applied thickly, effectively pushing Watson’s luminous figure behind its shallow barrier.

**Condition history** 
The painting is in overall good condition. The canvas is lined, the original stretcher and tacking edges absent.
