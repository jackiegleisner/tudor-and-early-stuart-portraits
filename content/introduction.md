Although known as a collection of eighteenth and early-nineteenth century art, the Yale Center for British Art is home to a significant number of portraits from the Tudor and Early Stuart period. For many years, these portraits remained understudied. The works varied in both their state of preservation and their significance. Some were attributed to the handful of artists whose names are known from the period, and others, typically in a poorer state, were consigned to storage and anonymity. 

Over the past decade and a half, several UK-based collections have produced technical catalogues of their early portraits, yielding a host of discoveries about contemporary studio practice, while demonstrating the pivotal role that scientific analysis can play in establishing a technical profile of the working methods of specific artists. In effort to utilize these new sources and better understand our own early portraits, YCBA staff has developed an in-depth technical catalogue comprising its thirty plus full-size oil paintings and fifteen miniatures. Many of the paintings were once part of a set of portraits that have splintered over the centuries. Much of the work of this project has involved the careful recovery of all the evidence that survives for these otherwise poorly documented paintings. Integral to this process has been collaboration and the sharing of data with other institutions resulting in the largest technical survey of portrait production in early modern Britain. 

Partnering with Yaleâ€™s Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage, the project has benefitted from cutting-edge technologies that can look through the veils of age and condition to shed new light on some of the most important paintings and painters of the period. The result of this synthesis of conservation, art history and science is the most thoroughgoing account of Tudor and early Stuart painting.
