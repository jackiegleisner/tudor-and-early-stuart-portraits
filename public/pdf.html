                  Although known as a collection of eighteenth and
                  early-nineteenth century art, the Yale Center for British Art
                  is home to a significant number of portraits from the Tudor
                  and Early Stuart period. For many years, these portraits
                  remained understudied. The works varied in both their state of
                  preservation and their significance. Some were attributed to
                  the handful of artists whose names are known from the period,
                  and others, typically in a poorer state, were consigned to
                  storage and anonymity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the past decade and a half, several UK-based collections
                  have produced technical catalogues of their early portraits,
                  yielding a host of discoveries about contemporary studio
                  practice, while demonstrating the pivotal role that scientific
                  analysis can play in establishing a technical profile of the
                  working methods of specific artists. In effort to utilize
                  these new sources and better understand our own early
                  portraits, YCBA staff has developed an in-depth technical
                  catalogue comprising its thirty plus full-size oil paintings
                  and fifteen miniatures. Many of the paintings were once part
                  of a set of portraits that have splintered over the centuries.
                  Much of the work of this project has involved the careful
                  recovery of all the evidence that survives for these otherwise
                  poorly documented paintings. Integral to this process has been
                  collaboration and the sharing of data with other institutions
                  resulting in the largest technical survey of portrait
                  production in early modern Britain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Partnering with Yale’s Institute for the Preservation of
                  Cultural Heritage, the project has benefitted from
                  cutting-edge technologies that can look through the veils of
                  age and condition to shed new light on some of the most
                  important paintings and painters of the period. The result of
                  this synthesis of conservation, art history and science is the
                  most thoroughgoing account of Tudor and early Stuart painting.

                      This painting is newly identified as Elizabeth, daughter
                      of Sir Thomas Watson (d. 1621) of Westminster and
                      Halstead, Kent. The reidentification of the sitter is
                      largely based on the striking resemblance between her and
                      a portrait of Elizabeth Watson now at Tate Britain
                      (<strong>fig. 1.1</strong>). Close comparison and an
                      overlay of the two faces reveals that this is the same
                      likeness, reversed and reused. The original source, most
                      likely a drawing taken from life, was adjusted minimally
                      to accommodate a slight shift in angle; in the Tate
                      portrait, Watson’s face is narrower and seen more
                      frontally.

                    <h2>Making the painting</h2>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Support and preparation</strong><br>
                      The portrait was completed in oil on a plain-weave linen
                      canvas. The canvas was prepared with a white chalk ground
                      followed by a light gray secondary ground composed of lead
                      white and bone black pigment, typical of Peake’s practice.
                      Peake used a dry, carbon-based material to draw each part
                      of the composition: the figure, her costume, the
                      background, and the fictive oval frame. The reserved,
                      faint lines delineating Watson’s facial features indicate
                      that it was transferred from a pre-existing template or
                      sketch from life. In both the YCBA and Tate portraits, the
                      quality of line shifts from restrained and soft (on the
                      face) to general and energetic (on the hands, hair and
                      backgrounds), attesting to Peake’s confidence in working
                      independently from a pattern, especially surrounding the
                      sitter’s face (<strong>fig. 1.2</strong>).

                          pigment, the lines mostly ignored when paint was

                    <p>
                      In the Tate portrait, Elizabeth’s features were shifted
                      during the painting process, her nose, lips and right eye
                      moved upwards (<strong>fig. 1.3</strong>). While
                      pentimenti like these are often associated with primary
                      versions, or the artists’ first approach to a likeness, it
                      is more plausible that Peake’s first drawing of Watson was
                      for the formal portrait (at the YCBA), her rounded face
                      turned three quarters to the left represents his
                      conventional practice. The informality of the Tate
                      portrait, with a nipple exposed through her loose hair,
                      affirms that it would have been displayed privately and
                      was most likely produced from the same drawing made for
                      Peake’s more ‘public’ portrait (at the YBCA), explaining
                      why her features were altered in the Tate version. In
                      other words, Peake did not have a new sitting with Watson
                      but reworked the source that he already had to fulfil this
                      unusual commission.

                      <strong>Paint layer</strong><br>
                      The paint layer was built up using a mostly wet-over-dry,
                      economical system with two distinctive methods of
                      application. The first is characterized by meticulous
                      blending to form soft gradations and three-dimensional
                      volumes, the second by a looser, brusquer technique in
                      which brushwork was left visible and each unblended stoke
                      forms a component of the composition (a highlight on
                      drapery, one strand of a feather, a sliver thread). Peake
                      first painted broad fields of a mid-tone color to serve as
                      a base for Watson’s flesh, hair, costume, and background.
                      The sequence of paint application shows that he ‘worked
                      up’ each element in the portrait simultaneously, allowing
                      one passage (like the dress or background) to dry while
                      he, or his assistants, moved on to another; a
                      time-efficient and labor-saving system.

                      <strong>Flesh</strong><br>
                      Because the flesh paint was applied so thinly, the gray
                      ground remains visible around Watson’s features, imparting
                      a cool tone to her complexion. The artist then used a
                      transparent brown paint, a mixture of ochers and earth
                      pigment like umber, to reinforce the contours of the
                      facial features and hands (<strong>figs. 1.4 and 1.5</strong>). Typical of Peake’s approach to younger sitters, the
                      brushwork on Watson’s flesh is closed, the paint softly
                      blended to a porcelain-like smoothness. Above this, a
                      fine-tipped sable brush was used to draw individual
                      eyelashes, her cupid bow lip crease and the network of
                      blue lines across her pale décolletage and temples that
                      suggest veins beneath the skin (<strong>fig. 1.6</strong>).

                      <strong>Jewelry and lace</strong><br>
                      The costume and jewelry are defined by crisp, unblended
                      brushwork. Atop the silver-grey base of Watson’s dress,
                      Peake used pure black and white pigment to indicate
                      embroidery, spangles, appliqué rosettes, and delicate
                      lace. These brushstrokes sit proud of the paint surface to
                      yield a network of tactile metallic threads and sparkles.
                      (<strong>fig. 1.7</strong>) Gold mounted jewels were first
                      blocked in with iron-based pigment, like brown ocher. When
                      dry, the body colors of the gems and enamel were added;
                      charcoal black for the diamonds and black enamel; lead
                      white, azurite and vermilion for the colored enamel. Above
                      this, shadows and highlights were added to lend depth to
                      the stones and three dimensionality to the enamelwork. The
                      pearls were completed in a similar, basically three-step,
                      system beginning with a gray base layer followed by cool
                      and warm highlights: bluish, azurite-containing stokes at
                      left and buttery (lead tin) yellow dashes at right. Daubs
                      of the same stiff yellow were applied across all gold
                      jewelry to form sharp prongs and highlights, their
                      frequency varied for a naturalistic twinkle (<strong>fig. 1.8</strong>).

                      <strong>Background</strong><br>
                      As noted above, the background and fictive oval were
                      worked up in tandem with Watson’s figure. The folds of
                      drapery were painted using mostly vermilion and lead white
                      paint, above which layers of a deep red glaze were added
                      to strengthen shadows and impart a berry-red sheen. Her
                      lace was added between these two stages of drapery
                      painting, the red glaze occasionally overlapping the lace
                      (<strong>figs 1.9 and 1.10</strong>). The reason for this
                      is practical. Red lake dries very slowly, is easily
                      smudged and is sticky when wet; resultantly, it is usually
                      among the last pigments applied. The oval frame was
                      rendered in three steps, beginning with a thin base of
                      yellow ocher. When this had completely dried the
                      figurative elements were added with a lean mixture of
                      brown earth and umber. The thin, inner edge of the frame
                      was among the last details added to the composition, its
                      bright yellow highlight (yellow ocher and lead white)
                      applied thickly, effectively pushing Watson’s luminous
                      figure behind its shallow barrier.

                    <h2>Making the painting</h2>
                    <p>
                      This miniature was executed in watercolor on vellum
                      adhered to card. On the reverse of the card are diagonal
                      lines of black and blue paint (<strong>fig. 2.1</strong>).
                      The slightly raised “lips” along the edges of the black
                      lines suggest they were masked off before application. The
                      pattern may relate to a playing card, which were commonly
                      used as a support for miniatures in this period although
                      in most cases the suit or face of the card is visible on
                      the verso.

                      <strong>Flesh</strong><br>
                      The first pigment layer laid down was the “carnation,” a
                      flesh-colored ground described by Hillard in his treatise
                      <em>Concerning the Arte of Limning</em>. Here, it is thick
                      enough to cover the texture of the vellum although its hue
                      is pale, comprising sparce black and red particles, the
                      latter identified as vermilion. There are a scattered pale
                      pink particles in this layer, apparently a faded red lake
                      (glaze) pigment, but it is unlikely that these would have
                      altered the complexion significantly. There is little
                      modelling in the flesh. The cheekbones and neck bear faint
                      strokes of a carbon-based black paint. The bridge of the
                      nose is captured with a faint line of this paint. The
                      nostril was placed with a warm reddish-brown paint
                      followed by a yellowish (organic lake) shadow, the thin
                      wash spread over across the underside of the nose (<strong>fig. 2.2</strong>). The lips were painted with stippled brushstrokes of a
                      pale red paint containing vermilion pigment while the lip
                      crease and corners were defined with halting strokes of a
                      red lake, now brown in hue due to discoloration and
                      fading. There is little modelling around the mouth area
                      except for a few strokes of thin brown paint beneath the
                      lower lip.

                      <strong>Eyes</strong><br>
                      The eyes were first defined with a thin wash of warm brown
                      paint containing red earth particles (<strong>fig. 2.3</strong>). The pupils, rendered with a burnt (bone) black,
                      overlap these lines and are slightly raised. The gray
                      color irises, a mixture of black and white pigment, were
                      painted in next, beginning with a thin overall wash and
                      then tiny, discreet stokes that define the outer edge of
                      each. The whites of the eyes were painted more thickly
                      with lead white-containing paint, which has developed
                      small cracks. The highlights on the eyes were added over
                      the pupils and irises with the same creamy white paint.
                      Eyelashes were indicated with minute, broken strokes of
                      dark brown/black pigment dotting the line of the upper
                      eyelid. The eye sockets show little extant modelling, some
                      of which may be lost to the fading of lake pigments; for
                      example, the inner corners of the eyes retain a subtle
                      rosy hue (perhaps once a deep pink) and there are faint
                      strokes of light brown beneath the eye which may have been
                      reinforced with a red or yellow lake.

                      <strong>Hair</strong><br>
                      The layer structure of the hair and its interplay with the
                      background is complex, demonstrating how well planned the
                      composition was at an early stage. Tendrils of hair were
                      first placed with a thin wash of earth-based pigment. The
                      azurite blue background was then “floated in” around the
                      sitter’s silhouette and certain tendrils of hair. Due to
                      the coarseness or grittiness of high-grade azurite, it
                      does not flow willingly off the brush the way other
                      pigments do in a watercolor medium. Hilliard describes his
                      practice of wetting the area destined for azurite and
                      letting the pigment flow into the passage. This is well
                      illustrated in an X-ray fluorescence scan, which shows how
                      the copper-based pigment creates a halo around the
                      sitter’s head, its concentration dissipating as it nears
                      her silhouette (<strong>fig. 2.4</strong>). Texture was
                      then added to the hair using brown and yellow ocher
                      pigment, building from dark shadows to a light warm brown
                      for highlights on the waves, some of this paint added on
                      top of the dry blue background (<strong>fig. 2.5</strong>).

                      <strong>Dress</strong><br>
                      The red color of the dress was blocked in with a red lake,
                      now notably faded. This red does not overlap decorative
                      elements on the dress, affirming that the design was
                      planned from the outset and that Hillard used his
                      materials judiciously. Indeed, lines of a carbon-based
                      black paint can be seen through upper paint layers
                      following the contours of the dress and its ornament,
                      indicating that its details were sketched, perhaps to
                      emulate a real garment owned by the sitter. Similar
                      guidelines are visible on the unfinished miniature
                      portrait by Isaac Oliver (Hilliard’s pupil) of Elizabeth I
                      now at the Victorian &amp; Albert Museum (<strong>fig. 2.6</strong>) Dashes of lead white were next added to her sleeve and
                      the left side of her torso, lending three-dimensionality
                      to the dress. More red lake was applied on top of this to
                      maintain the garment’s deep, berry red color, the thicker
                      dashes of shadow along her right side the most intact
                      today.

                      Lace was added after the hair and the red paint on the
                      dress were dry, the basic pattern drawn with a light gray
                      paint followed by impasto highlights of pure lead white,
                      which, like the white on her eyes, has developed its own
                      craquelure. The now black, lacy stripes on the dress were
                      once vibrant silver, confirmed by XRF analysis (<strong>fig. 2.7</strong>). These were among the last details added to the
                      composition. The silver overlaps the sitter’s lace and
                      even the gold border around the perimeter of the
                      miniature, yet in some places it lies beneath final
                      highlights, affirming that Hilliard went back to tweak
                      details and add finishing touches (<strong>fig. 2.8</strong>).

                      <strong>Jewelry</strong><br>
                      Each pearl of the sitter’s necklace and earrings were
                      created with a single dot of pure lead white paint,
                      delivered from the tip of a fine brush. Each received a
                      single highlight of silver, similar to what we see today,
                      although these highlights are restoration, concealing the
                      original, tarnished silver. The setting for her pearl drop
                      earring was first painted with yellow ochre and then
                      highlighted with shell gold. Apart from the thin gold
                      boarder, that is the only gold present in the portrait
                      (<strong>fig. 2.9</strong>).
